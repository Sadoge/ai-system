# ai-system

An AI Software Engineering Platform: a deterministic orchestration system that manages a team of AI agents through the full software development lifecycle — from Jira ticket to human-approved pull request.

This is not a coding agent. It is the machinery around agents: pipeline orchestration, project knowledge (the Project Brain), provider-agnostic model routing, human review gates, and full auditability. LLMs make decisions inside well-defined boundaries; humans make the final calls.

## Status

**Phase 0 — Foundations** ([roadmap](docs/10-roadmap.md)): the monorepo skeleton, deterministic
`advance()` engine with replay tests, Postgres schema + transactional outbox, Model Gateway v1
(Anthropic + OpenAI adapters, ledger, budget guard), pg-boss worker, and operator CLI are built.
The trivial pipeline (intake → echo agent → done) runs end-to-end and survives worker crashes.
The API and web UI arrive with Phase 1.

### Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d   # Postgres 16 + pgvector
cp .env.example .env

node apps/cli/dist/main.js db migrate
node apps/cli/dist/main.js seed
node apps/worker/dist/main.js &                            # or: pnpm --filter @ai-system/worker dev

echo '# My first ticket' > ticket.md
node apps/cli/dist/main.js run start ticket.md
node apps/cli/dist/main.js run status <run-id>
```

`pnpm test` runs the engine replay tests and gateway tests; no database or API key required.
