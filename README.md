# ai-system

An AI Software Engineering Platform: a deterministic orchestration system that manages a team of AI agents through the full software development lifecycle — from Jira ticket to human-approved pull request.

This is not a coding agent. It is the machinery around agents: pipeline orchestration, project knowledge (the Project Brain), provider-agnostic model routing, human review gates, and full auditability. LLMs make decisions inside well-defined boundaries; humans make the final calls.

## Status

**Design phase.** The complete system design lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md):

- [High-Level Architecture](docs/01-architecture.md)
- [Bounded Contexts](docs/02-bounded-contexts.md)
- [Domain Model](docs/03-domain-model.md)
- [Database Design](docs/04-database-design.md)
- [Event Flow](docs/05-event-flow.md)
- [Agent Lifecycle](docs/06-agent-lifecycle.md)
- [Model Management](docs/07-model-management.md)
- [Project Brain](docs/08-project-brain.md)
- [Technology Stack](docs/09-technology-stack.md)
- [Roadmap & MVP](docs/10-roadmap.md)
